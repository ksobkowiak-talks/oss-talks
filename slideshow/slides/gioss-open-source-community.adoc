== Governance/Community

// ***************************************************************************

=== Community

* AKA: Governance
** Defines how the community operates
** How conflicts are resolved
** Growth path of the communit
*** code
*** members
** Again, 3 main types

// ***************************************************************************

=== Governance Models

* Walled Garden
** "All your base are belong to us.""
* Benevolent Dictator
** "Supreme executive power derives from a mandate from the masses, not some farcical aquatic ceremony."
* Meritocratic Community
** "Out of Chaos comes Order."

=== Walled Garden

// ***************************************************************************

=== Walled Garden

* Generally Licensed under copyleft-ish license (GPL)
* Involvement in code is closed
* Commit/patches limited to company employees
** Any accepted code has stringent assignments (copyright)
* Code benefits mainly the corporate key-holders.
* "Crowd-sourcing"
* Final say in direction: not the coders but the owners.
** Example: Spring and Java (kinda)

// ***************************************************************************

=== BDFL

// ***************************************************************************

=== Benevolent Dictator

* Licensed under All Open Source licenses
* Involvement in code is open and based on merit.
** Easy to provide patches/code
* Single Dictator or Dictator with Generals (depending on size and complexity of the code)
* Dictator (and Generals) non-aligned with corporate interests.
* The community assigns power to Dictator who has final say if needed
** Example: Think Linus and Linux.

// ***************************************************************************

=== Meritocracy


// ***************************************************************************

=== Meritocracy

* Generally Licensed under liberal license (AL)
* Involvement in code is open and based on merit.
** Easiest model to provide code (simple, but complete, IP clearance: no assign copyright)
* Clearly defined path based on merit
* Collaboration and Community Consensus is critical
** Example: Think Apache Software Foundation.
