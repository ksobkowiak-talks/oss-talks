== Licenses

// ***************************************************************************
=== Why?

* Copyright is the default
* Open Source is everywhere
* The license determines use, re-use and distribution
* Not understanding means risk

// ***************************************************************************
=== License Goals

* Ensure what parts remain open source
* Maintain control over code and direction
* Provide common implementation for standards
* Build community or commercial marketplace
* For most end-users, this is the sole touch-point

// ***************************************************************************
=== True Open Source

* For software to be Open Source, it must be under an OSI or FSF approved Open Source License
* Open Source Definition: link:http://www.opensource.org/docs/osd[]
* Free Software Definition: link:http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.html[]
* At last count, over 60 exist
* New Open Source licenses are very hard to get approved
* There are really 3 main types


// ***************************************************************************
=== Open Source Licenses

* Give Me Credit
** AL (Apache License), BSD, MIT
* Give Me Fixes
** LGPL (Lesser GPL), EPL (Eclipse Public License), MPL (Mozilla Public License)
* Give Me Everything
** GPL (General Public License)

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Credit

* AL, BSD, MIT

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Credit

* A liberal open source software license
* Business friendly
* Requires attribution
* No warranty
* Easily reused by other projects & organizations (universal donor)
* Legally, not complex

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Credit

* Community Impacts:
** Limited control by a single entity
** Little value in direct competition
** Used in widest variety of community types

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Fixes

* LGPL, EPL, MPL

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Fixes

* Used mostly with platforms or libraries
* sources != binaries
* Protects the licensed code, but allows larger derivative works with different licensing
* Still very business friendly
* Could create some legal questions

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Fixes

* Community Impacts:
** Easier single entity control
** Direct development/improvements of the code benefits all


// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Everything

* GPL

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Everything

* Derivative works also under GPL
* Linked works could also be under GPL
* Viral nature may likely limit adoption
* GPL trumps all others or else incompatible
* legally, most complex

// ***************************************************************************
=== Give Me Everything

* Community Impacts:
** "Forces"/"enables" dual-license business strategy for copyright holder
** Encourages full free-software community
*** Direct development/improvements of any uses of the code benefits all, but mostly the orig. author(s)
** Contributors guaranteed all code will be free

// ***************************************************************************
=== License Differences

* How "viral" the license and its conditions are
* Mainly involve the licensing of derivative works
* Only really applies during (re)distribution of work
* Where the "freedom" should be mostly focused: the user or the code itself

// ***************************************************************************
=== One True License

* There is no such thing
* Licensing is selected to address what you are trying to do
* In general, Open Standards do better with AL-like license
* If wide adoption is important to you: again AL.
* To restrict non-shared private enhancements, copyleft.
